Project Tracker

 

Project Tracker is a system that allows the instructor to track the work of a group of students on a specific project. At the same time students can use the system to manage their work and with the instructor. Suppose we have a class with enough number of students to be divided into two groups or more, Therefore, the instructor has the ability to assign each student to a specific team and give each member a specific role. Moreover, the instructor can create a project with required specifications and properties such as tasks, time, deliverables, etc. Students in the same team can communicate together by broadcasting a message that appears on all team members' side. They can also communicate with the instructor.

At any time, students can set the status of a task as to start later on, working on, finished on time, finished with delay, etc. and the instructor can review the task and give feedback for students on the task. 

The task has a title, description, progress estimation, start date, end due date, actual end date, or any other suggested properties. The task can be assigned to one or more of the students. Group members or the instructor can put a comment on the task and others can reply to it. 

Your team must create four deliverables:

Phase 1: Analysis
At the end of analysis phase, you have to submit 
An initial requirements document.
An initial problem description
A tentative project plan.
 Each member role in each phase.
For individual submission, each student should submit a text file presents each member contributions in this phase. (Write your thought and donâ€™t share it with others) 

Phae2: Design phase:

You need to submit the following:

I. The UML of the system. The UML diagram should have all details such as, attribute, method, relationship, cardinality, etc. Your UML should follow the UML standards, shapes, lines, capital and small word, underlines, etc.Also, you need to create sequence diagram, it shows object interactions arranged in time sequence in the field of software engineering.
